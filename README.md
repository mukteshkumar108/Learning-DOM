# DOM Practice 

This repository is created **only for my personal practice and learning** of JavaScript DOM concepts.

I will keep experimenting here, building small examples and mini projects as I learn.
There is no fixed structure, no final goal, and no guarantee of clean code.

---

## Purpose

* Practice JavaScript DOM basics
* Try things, break things, and learn from it
* Track my learning progress publicly

If you are here expecting a polished project, you can safely ignore this repository.

---

## What You’ll Find Here

* Small DOM experiments
* Basic interactions with HTML elements
* Simple JavaScript logic used for learning

Everything here is part of my learning process.

---

## Note

This repository is **not meant for production use**.
It exists only to help me learn by doing.
