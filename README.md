Perfect — that intent is clear, and this README should **explicitly say “this is for practice, feel free to ignore”** in a simple, honest way.
Below is a **short, beginner-friendly, human README** that fits exactly what you described and looks natural on GitHub.

You can copy this **as-is**.

# DOM Practice Playground

This repository is created **only for my personal practice and learning** of JavaScript DOM concepts.

I will keep experimenting here, building small examples and mini projects as I learn.
There is no fixed structure, no final goal, and no guarantee of clean code.

---

## Purpose

* Practice JavaScript DOM basics
* Try things, break things, and learn from it
* Track my learning progress publicly

If you are here expecting a polished project, you can safely ignore this repository.

---

## What You’ll Find Here

* Small DOM experiments
* Basic interactions with HTML elements
* Simple JavaScript logic used for learning

Everything here is part of my learning process.

---

## Note

This repository is **not meant for production use**.
It exists only to help me learn by doing.
